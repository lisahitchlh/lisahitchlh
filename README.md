  <summary>Case Study 1: Consulting at a large bank</summary>
  
  During a 5-month engagement with a large bank's Analytics Enablement team, Lisa utilized SQL to optimize Tableau workbook performance through database-side using joins, ETCs, and filtering. She then built dashboards on SLA performance, customer language preferences, and exploration tools for trusted data sources. To streamline development, Lisa created a Tableau dashboard template and iterated it based on business needs in collaboration with business stakeholders and data analysts. Additionally, she developed and led a customized 3-part interactive workshop series, covering Tableau topics from beginner to advanced, including breadcrumbing for parameters and filters and dynamic zone visibility.
